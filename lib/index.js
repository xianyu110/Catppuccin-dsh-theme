 * lives in the browser half (`./client`), which DSH's dsh-client-modules
 * picks up through the package's `dsh.client` declaration — the same shape
 * as the shipped ui-* packages. The theme choice is persisted in
 * localStorage, because the Host settings wire only exposes an allowlisted
 * set of namespaces to browser clients.
